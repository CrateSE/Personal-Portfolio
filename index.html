							<p>Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I'm Shadi El-Fares, a passionate and driven individual with a diverse background that spans technology and engineering.</p>
							<p>From an early age, technology has been an integral part of my life. As a curious child, I found myself dismantling old laptops, fixing phones, and building computers. These experiences ignited a spark within me, fueling my fascination with innovation and problem-solving. I have always been drawn to the ever-evolving world of technology and the limitless possibilities it offers.</p>
							<p>As I grew older, I realized that my affinity for problem-solving and my insatiable curiosity were leading me towards a career in engineering. It was a revelation that helped me shape my future path. I have a particular interest in software engineering, enticed by the endless opportunities in cloud-based creation. However, I also have a deep appreciation for mechatronics, as it allows me to combine my love for hands-on building with technological advancements.</p>
							<p>To pursue my passion and nurture my engineering skills, I decided to enroll in McMaster University for my first year of General Engineering. This decision allows me to explore different disciplines and discover my true calling. McMaster University provides an ideal environment for me to channel my creative ideas and hone my technical expertise, as I strive to make a meaningful impact in the industry I choose.</p>
							<p>I am eternally grateful to my parents, who made tremendous sacrifices in their own careers to provide my siblings and me with opportunities. Their unwavering support and guidance have shaped my character and instilled in me a strong work ethic. It is their selflessness that motivates me to seize every opportunity and strive for excellence in all that I do.</p>
							<p>Through this portfolio website, I aim to showcase my journey as a technology enthusiast and aspiring engineer. I am driven by a deep sense of purpose and an unwavering belief in the power of technology and innovation to transform lives on a global scale. Join me as I engineer the future, empowering individuals and making a lasting impact through my dedication and relentless pursuit of excellence. </p>
							<p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio website, and I invite you to explore my projects, achievements, and aspirations. Together, let's make a difference in the world through the transformative power of technology and engineering.</p>
